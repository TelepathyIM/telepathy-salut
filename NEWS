telepathy-salut 0.3.3 (2008-06-05)
==================================
This unstable release mainly brings an abstraction of the avahi layer making
it easier to use different implementions of mdns or other completely different
service discovery implementations. Furthermore various small bugfixes has been
done and the complete code-base has been converted to telepathy coding style.

telepathy-salut 0.3.2 (2008-04-09)
==================================
This unstable release doesn't contain any new features or major changes but
fixes various Clique and tube bugs. These are basically the same fixes as in
the 0.2.3 stable release.

telepathy-salut 0.3.1 (2008-02-15)
==================================
This unstable release fixes few Clique crashers and some others issues.
Most of these bugs were discovered thanks to hyperactivity, a
collaboration stress testing tool we are developing for the OLPC project.

This new version also introduces a new DNS resolver in Gibber but it's not
used in Salut yet.

telepathy-salut 0.3.0 (2008-01-08)
==================================
This is the first release in the unstable 0.3 series.

Apart from some small bugfixes this updates the Avatar interface to comply with
the current telepathy spec and uses avahi-gobject instead of the internal avahi
gobject wrappers. This means at least avahi 0.6.22 is needed for this version.

As salut doesn't have persistent avatar storage, the clients need to ensure the
avatar is set upon each connection. See sf bug #1825366 [0] for the suggested
changes to telepathy-mission-control.
