telepathy-salut 0.2.1 (2008-01-08)
==================================
Apart from some small bugfixes this updates the Avatar interface to comply
with the current telepathy spec.

As salut doesn't have persistent avatar storage, the clients need to ensure the
avatar is set upon each connection. See sf bug #1825366 [0] for the suggested
changes to telepathy-mission-control.
