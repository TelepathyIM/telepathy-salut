==================================

Enhancements:
* Implement Connection.Interface.ContactCapabilities.DRAFT

  a string as UNIX socket address.

telepathy-salut 0.3.8 (2009-02-17)
==================================
The "Thursday as if I walked in the dessert" release.

Enhancements:
* Switched to the stable version of the FileTransfer interface. Clients
  (Empathy, Sugar...) have to be modified to use the stable interface instead
  of the DRAFT one. Just the interface name has been renamed so changes
  should be trivial.

telepathy-salut 0.3.7 (2009-01-05)
==================================
The "Post-Waffle Hibernation" release.

Enhancements:
* State of pending file transfer channels is now automatically changed to
  "Cancelled" if peer is disconnected.

Fixes:
* Uses libsoup 2.4 instead of the obsolete 2.2 version (b.fd.o #18891).
* Don't crash if the XMPP connection is disconnected during a file transfer.
* Fix a race in stream tubes causing potential data lost.
* Fix various leaks including one leading to a crash (b.fd.o #19181).

* libsoup-2.2

Enhancements:

  This means you can now send files to your Salut contacts. Current
  implementation uses OOB (XEP-0066) and is fully compatible with iChat.
* All channels are now requestable using the new
  org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection.Interface.Requests interface.

Fixes:

  a local pending room (b.fd.o #18552).

The "Please don't flood my network" release.

This release fixes an annoying bug causing Salut announcing all the OLPC
activities which are present on the network. You should consider upgrading
if they are OLPC XO's running on your network.

Enhancements:

* Add a test framework

Fixes:

* Only announce OLPC activity we actually joined (dev.laptop.org #8441)

telepathy-salut 0.3.4 (2008-08-20)

The "a ball of hair" release.

Requirements:

* telepathy-glib >= 0.7.14

Enhancements:

* Implement the Contacts interface
* Implement the SimplePresence interface
* Implement spec 0.17.9 (Add various properties to all channels)

telepathy-salut 0.3.3 (2008-06-05)
==================================
This unstable release mainly brings an abstraction of the avahi layer making
it easier to use different implementions of mdns or other completely different
service discovery implementations. Furthermore various small bugfixes has been
done and the complete code-base has been converted to telepathy coding style.

telepathy-salut 0.3.2 (2008-04-09)
==================================
This unstable release doesn't contain any new features or major changes but
fixes various Clique and tube bugs. These are basically the same fixes as in
the 0.2.3 stable release.

telepathy-salut 0.3.1 (2008-02-15)
==================================
This unstable release fixes few Clique crashers and some others issues.
Most of these bugs were discovered thanks to hyperactivity, a
collaboration stress testing tool we are developing for the OLPC project.

This new version also introduces a new DNS resolver in Gibber but it's not
used in Salut yet.

telepathy-salut 0.3.0 (2008-01-08)
==================================
This is the first release in the unstable 0.3 series.

Apart from some small bugfixes this updates the Avatar interface to comply with
the current telepathy spec and uses avahi-gobject instead of the internal avahi
gobject wrappers. This means at least avahi 0.6.22 is needed for this version.

As salut doesn't have persistent avatar storage, the clients need to ensure the
avatar is set upon each connection. See sf bug #1825366 [0] for the suggested
changes to telepathy-mission-control.
