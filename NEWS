telepathy-salut 0.3.1 (2008-02-15)
==================================
This unstable release fixes few Clique crashers and some others issues.
Most of these bugs were discovered thanks to hyperactivity, a
collaboration stress testing tool we are developing for the OLPC project.

This new version also introduces a new DNS resolver in Gibber but it's not
used in Salut yet.

telepathy-salut 0.3.0 (2008-01-08)
==================================
This is the first release in the unstable 0.3 series.

Apart from some small bugfixes this updates the Avatar interface to comply with
the current telepathy spec and uses avahi-gobject instead of the internal avahi
gobject wrappers. This means at least avahi 0.6.22 is needed for this version.

As salut doesn't have persistent avatar storage, the clients need to ensure the
avatar is set upon each connection. See sf bug #1825366 [0] for the suggested
changes to telepathy-mission-control.
