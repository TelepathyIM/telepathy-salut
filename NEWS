telepathy-salut 0.5.1 (UNRELEASED)
==================================

...

telepathy-salut 0.5.0 (2011-05-03)
==================================

Enhancements:

 * The wocky library used in telepathy-gabble has been added as a
   submodule and is starting to replace bits of Gibber such As
   GibberXmppNode → WockyNode, and GibberXmppStanza →
   WockyStanza. Keep on reading for more. (smcv, jonny)

 * The test suite now has a mock Avahi service, so running the tests
   no longer uses the system avahi and therefore doesn't pop up
   contacts on other users' contact lists. You can hit the actual
   network if you want though, see tests/README. (tomeu, smcv, jonny)

 * Implement ofdT.Protocol objects for exposed protocols. (smcv)

 * Replace the capability channel manager interfaces with the new ones
   already used in Gabble which make the caps situation a lot more
   sane. (smcv)

 * Implement ContactCapabilities. (jonny)

 * fd.o#33833: Implement FileTransfer.FileURI (cassidy)

 * Use Wocky's caps hashing code, and so throw out Salut's own code
   for this. (jonny)

 * Give Salut a plugin API, based on the Gabble one. The API consists
   of a little bit of Salut, Wocky and tp-glib. Plugins can expose new
   protocols and can add channel managers. Brill. (jonny)

 * The C tests now use GLib instead of check. (stefw)

 * Salut's XMPP connection manager has been replaced with Wocky's Meta
   Porter. This is better in many ways. (jonny)

 * Add salut_send_ll_pep_event() function to send a pep message (this
   is basically the only step needed for link-local PEP
   support). (jonny)

Fixes:

 * Ensure to reply to disco requests with the same id attribute and
   other test reliability fixes. (smcv)

 * fd.o#31665: use TpDBusDaemon, not tp_get_bus(). (smcv)

Dependencies:

 * xmldiff is now a required dependency otherwise the gibber tests
   fail. It has always been required but it was never checked at
   configure time.

 * GLib ≥ 2.24 is now required.

 * telepathy-glib ≥ 0.13.12 is now required.

telepathy-salut 0.4.0 (2010-09-06)
===================================

The "a stable branch that doesn't go anywhere is the most stable of all"
release.

Fixes:

* Remove the GibberResolver and all its infrastructure (smcv)
* Use the normal, safer telepathy-glib priv idioms (smcv)
* Add salut_connection_get_implemented_interfaces (smcv)
* Make tests more robust (smcv)
* Remove examples and OpenSSL support from libgibber (smcv)
* remove SASL support (smcv)
* remove now-unused MD5 implementation (smcv)
* Remove the activity when its channel has been closed, as Gabble does (tomeu)

telepathy-salut 0.3.13 (2010-08-19)
===================================

The "treitter has a list somewhere on the telepathy wiki if you're stuck"
release.

Enhancements:

* Implement avatar requirements properties (Zdra)

* Add a ActivityProperties.GetActivity method for retrieving an activity's room
  handle from its id (tomeu)

* Add a BuddyInfo.AddActivity method so activities can advertise themselves
  without having to track all the other shared activities (tomeu)

Fixes:

* Update with-session-bus.sh from telepathy-glib, fixing a bashism (smcv)

telepathy-salut 0.3.12 (2010-05-20)
===================================

The "maybe your browser has turned religious" release.

Enhancements:

* Merge back most of the portability improvements from Gabble's copy of Gibber
  (smcv)

* Use automake silent rules (--enable-silent-rules) instead of shave (smcv)

Fixes:

* fd.o #22970, Debian #565154: don't try to support credential-passing on
  non-Linux platforms, fixing compilation there (smcv)

* fd.o #27289: set the Properties flag on group channels for round-trip
  reduction (cassidy)

* fd.o #20732 (partial): allow the user to leave MUCs with RemoveMembers()
  (smcv)

* Implement the error path for ContactList channel requests correctly (smcv)

* Fix compilation in the tr_TR.UTF-8 locale (Maiku)

* Use the right timestamps on message delivery reports (Jonny)

* Stop working around fd.o #15092, which was fixed in telepathy-glib (cassidy)

* fd.o #26152: make critical warnings fatal by default (smcv)

telepathy-salut 0.3.11 (2010-03-25)
===================================
The "Not really" release.

Enhancements:
* Implement TpMessageMixin and therefore the Channel.Interface.Messages.

Fixes:
* Fix strict aliasing warnings from gcc.
* Fix assertion due to g_set_prgname being called twice.


telepathy-salut 0.3.10 (2009-09-10)
===================================
The "The lampshade of doom" release.

Requirements:
* telepathy-glib >= 0.7.36 is now required so Salut emits the correct
  D-Bus errors. This version is also requiered as we implement the
  new tube API and the Debug interface.

Enhancements:
* Implement the final, stable new API for tubes. The NewConnection signal has
  been renamed to NewRemoteConnection and now has a Connection_ID argument.  The
  StreamTube channel type now implements the NewLocalConnection and
  ConnectionClosed signals. DBusTube.{Offer,Accept} now have an access_control
  argument.

* Use ContactCapabilities draft to communicate tube support.

* In StreamTube, UNIX sockets created with the Localhost access control are
  usable by any user of the system.

* Implement Debug interface.

Fixes:
* Include muc tube channels in Requests's Channels property.

* Implement setting presence before the connection is
  established. This allows salut to be used with mission control >=
  5.2.2.

* Make the "dnd" presence actually correspond to the correct telepathy
  presence type.


telepathy-salut 0.3.9 (2009-04-02)
==================================
The "My, what big branches you have, Grandma!" release.

Enhancements:
* Implement Connection.Interface.ContactCapabilities.DRAFT
* Implement tube service specific contact capabilities.
* Implement file transfer contact capabilities.
* Implement Channel.Type.StreamTube.DRAFT

Fixes:
* As defined in the spec, {Accept,Provide}File should return an 'ay' and not
  a string as UNIX socket address.
* Fix a crash with newer versions of libsoup
* Fix file transfer over IPv6 (b.fd.o #19163)


telepathy-salut 0.3.8 (2009-02-17)
==================================
The "Thursday as if I walked in the dessert" release.

Enhancements:
* Switched to the stable version of the FileTransfer interface. Clients
  (Empathy, Sugar...) have to be modified to use the stable interface instead
  of the DRAFT one. Just the interface name has been renamed so changes
  should be trivial.

Fixes:
* Fix a crash when receiving an incoming XMPP connection from a IPv6 address.


telepathy-salut 0.3.7 (2009-01-05)
==================================
The "Post-Waffle Hibernation" release.

Requirements:
* libsoup-2.4 (instead of libsoup-2.2)

Enhancements:
* State of pending file transfer channels is now automatically changed to
  "Cancelled" if peer is disconnected.

Fixes:
* Uses libsoup 2.4 instead of the obsolete 2.2 version (b.fd.o #18891).
* Don't crash if the XMPP connection is disconnected during a file transfer.
* Fix a race in stream tubes causing potential data lost.
* Fix various leaks including one leading to a crash (b.fd.o #19181).


telepathy-salut 0.3.6 (2008-12-02)
==================================
The "I accidentally 93MB of .rar files" release.

Requirements:

* glib >= 2.16
* dbus >= 1.1.0
* telepathy-glib >= 0.7.17
* libsoup-2.2

Enhancements:

* Implement org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type.FileTransfer.DRAFT.
  This means you can now send files to your Salut contacts. Current
  implementation uses OOB (XEP-0066) and is fully compatible with iChat.
* All channels are now requestable using the new
  org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection.Interface.Requests interface.

Fixes:

* Assertion failed in gibber_multicast_transport_disconnect when closing
  a local pending room (b.fd.o #18552).


telepathy-salut 0.3.5 (2008-09-17)
==================================
The "Please don't flood my network" release.

This release fixes an annoying bug causing Salut announcing all the OLPC
activities which are present on the network. You should consider upgrading
if they are OLPC XO's running on your network.

Enhancements:

* Add a test framework

Fixes:

* Only announce OLPC activity we actually joined (dev.laptop.org #8441)

telepathy-salut 0.3.4 (2008-08-20)
==================================
The "a ball of hair" release.

Requirements:

* telepathy-glib >= 0.7.14

Enhancements:

* Implement the Contacts interface
* Implement the SimplePresence interface
* Implement spec 0.17.9 (Add various properties to all channels)

telepathy-salut 0.3.3 (2008-06-05)
==================================
This unstable release mainly brings an abstraction of the avahi layer making
it easier to use different implementions of mdns or other completely different
service discovery implementations. Furthermore various small bugfixes has been
done and the complete code-base has been converted to telepathy coding style.

telepathy-salut 0.3.2 (2008-04-09)
==================================
This unstable release doesn't contain any new features or major changes but
fixes various Clique and tube bugs. These are basically the same fixes as in
the 0.2.3 stable release.

telepathy-salut 0.3.1 (2008-02-15)
==================================
This unstable release fixes few Clique crashers and some others issues.
Most of these bugs were discovered thanks to hyperactivity, a
collaboration stress testing tool we are developing for the OLPC project.

This new version also introduces a new DNS resolver in Gibber but it's not
used in Salut yet.

telepathy-salut 0.3.0 (2008-01-08)
==================================
This is the first release in the unstable 0.3 series.

Apart from some small bugfixes this updates the Avatar interface to comply with
the current telepathy spec and uses avahi-gobject instead of the internal avahi
gobject wrappers. This means at least avahi 0.6.22 is needed for this version.

As salut doesn't have persistent avatar storage, the clients need to ensure the
avatar is set upon each connection. See sf bug #1825366 [0] for the suggested
changes to telepathy-mission-control.
