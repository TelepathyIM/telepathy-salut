telepathy-salut
===============

Salut is a link-local XMPP (XEP-0174) connection manager for the Telepathy
framework, currently supporting presence and single-user chats with iChat
interoperability, and multi-user chats and Tubes using the Clique protocol
<http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Clique>.

Telepathy is a D-Bus framework for unifying real time communication,
including instant messaging, voice calls and video calls. It abstracts
differences between protocols to provide a unified interface for
applications.

At build time, it also requires:
  GNU make <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>

Bugs, feature requests and to-do list

Versioning policy
=================

We use an "odd/even" versioning scheme where the minor version (the y in
x.y.z) determines stability - stable branches have y even, development
branches have y odd.

Unreleased builds straight from Darcs identify themselves as version
"x.y.z.1". These are compiled with -Werror, so they might stop working
if your gcc version issues more warnings than ours. If this is a problem
for you, use a release tarball.
