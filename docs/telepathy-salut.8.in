.SH NAME
telepathy-salut \- Telepathy connection manager for link-local XMPP
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@libexecdir@/telepathy\-salut\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Salut implements the Telepathy D-Bus specification for link-local XMPP
(XEP-0174, often called "Bonjour"), allowing Telepathy clients like
.BR empathy (1)
to communicate with other implementations of link-local XMPP, such as
iChat. It also extends the protocol to support multicast-based chat rooms
and collaboration.
.PP
It is a D-Bus service which runs on the session bus, and should usually be
started automatically by D-Bus activation. However, it might be useful to
start it manually for debugging.
.SH OPTIONS
There are no command-line options.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBSALUT_LOGFILE\fR=\fIfilename\fR
If set, debug output will go to the given file rather than to stderr.
.TP
\fBSALUT_DEBUG\fR=\fItype\fR
May be set to "all" for full debug output, or various undocumented options
(which may change from release to release) to filter the output.
\fBGIBBER_DEBUG\fR=\fItype\fR
May be set to "all" for full debug output from the Gibber XMPP library used by
Salut, or various undocumented options (which may change from release to
release) to filter the output.
