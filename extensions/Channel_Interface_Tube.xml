  <interface name="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Interface.Tube.DRAFT"

    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>A <i>tube</i> is a mechanism for arbitrary data transfer between
      two or more IM users, used to allow applications on the users'
      systems to communicate without having to establish network
      connections themselves. Currently, two types of tube exist:
      <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy"
      >Channel.Type.DBusTube</tp:dbus-ref> and
      <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy"
      >Channel.Type.StreamTube</tp:dbus-ref>. This interface contains
      the properties, signals and methods common to both types of tube;
      you can only create channels of a specific tube type, not of this
      type. A tube channel contains exactly one tube; if you need several
      tubes, you have to create several tube channels.</p>

      <p>Tube channels can be requested for handles of type
      HANDLE_TYPE_CONTACT (for 1-1 communication) or of type
      HANDLE_TYPE_ROOM (to communicate with others in the room
      simultaneously).</p>
    </tp:docstring>

        <p>When requesting a channel with 
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Connection.Interface.Requests.CreateChannel</tp:dbus-ref>,
          this property MUST NOT be included in the request.</p>

      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Each tube has a dictionary of arbitrary parameters. Parameters are
          commonly used for bootstrap information. The allowable keys,
          types and values are defined by the service. Connection managers
          must support the value being a string (D-Bus type 's'), array of bytes
          (D-Bus type 'ay'), unsigned integer (D-Bus type 'u'), integer (D-Bus
          type 'i') and boolean (D-Bus type 'b').</p>
        <p>When the tube is offered, the parameters are transmitted with the
          offer and appear as a property of the incoming tube for other
          participants.</p>
        <p>Example of valid parameters:
          <code>{'game name': 'go', 'board size': 19}</code></p>
        <p>When requesting a channel with 
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Connection.Interface.Requests.CreateChannel</tp:dbus-ref>,
          this property MAY be included in the request. If it is not included in
          the request, the connection manager MUST consider the property to be
          empty. This property MAY be changed after the channel creation when
          the tube is in the state Not_Offered. If the tube is in another
          state, changing this property MUST fail without side effect.</p>
