      <p>A D-Bus tube is an ordered reliable transport, for transporting D-Bus
        traffic.</p>

      <p>For each D-Bus tube, the connection manager listens on a D-Bus
        server address, as detailed in the D-Bus specification. On this
        address, it emulates a bus upon which each tube participant appears
        as an endpoint.</p>

      <p>The objects and interfaces which are expected to exist on the
        emulated bus depend on the well-known name; typically, either the
        participant who initiated the tube is expected to export the same
        objects/interfaces that would be exported by a service of that name
        on a bus, or all participants are expected to export those
        objects/interfaces.</p>

      <p>In a multi-user context (Handle_Type_Room) the tube behaves
        like the D-Bus bus daemon, so participants can send each other
        private messages, or can send broadcast messages which are
        received by everyone in the tube (including themselves).
        Each participant has a D-Bus unique name; connection managers
        MUST prevent participants from sending messages with the wrong
        sender unique name, and SHOULD attempt to avoid participants
        receiving messages not intended for them.</p>

      <p>In a 1-1 context (Handle_Type_Contact) the tube behaves like
        a peer-to-peer D-Bus connection - arbitrary D-Bus messages with
        any sender and/or destination can be sent by each participant,
        and each participant receives all messages sent by the other
        participant.</p>
