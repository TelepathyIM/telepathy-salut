    <tp:docstring>
      <p>A channel type for files offered for transferring.
      The actual transmission of the data is done by reading or writing
      a socket, the type of socket (local Unix, IPv4, etc.) when the File
      channel is created.</p>

      <p>The File channel type may be requested for handles of type
      HANDLE_TYPE_CONTACT.</p>
