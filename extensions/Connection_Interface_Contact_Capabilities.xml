      <p>An interface for connections where it is possible to know what channel
        classes may be created before the request is made to the connection
        object. Each capability represents a commitment by the connection
        manager that it will ordinarily be able to create a channel when given
        a request with the properties defined by the channel class.</p>

      <p>Capabilities pertain to particular contact handles, and represent
        activities such as having a text chat, a voice call with the user or a
        stream tube of a defined type.</p>

      <p>This interface also provides for user interfaces notifying the
        connection manager of what capabilities to advertise for the user. This
        is done by using the SetSelfCapabilities method, and deals with
        channel properties values pertaining to them which are implemented by
        available client processes.</p>

        <p>If a channel class is unknown by the connection manager, it is just
        ignored. No error are returned in this case, and other known channel
        class are added.</p>

        <p>Upon a successful invocation of this method, the
        ContactCapabilitiesChanged signal will be emitted for the user's own
        handle (as returned by GetSelfHandle) by the connection manager to
