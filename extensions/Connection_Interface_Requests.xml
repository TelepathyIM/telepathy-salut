      <p>An enhanced version of the Telepathy connection interface, which can
        represent bundles of channels that should be dispatched together, and
        does not assume any particular properties by which channels are
        uniquely identifiable.</p>

          <p>Properties of the channel.</p>

          <p>Connection managers MUST NOT include properties in this mapping
            if their values can change. Clients MUST ignore properties
            that appear in this mapping if their values can change.</p>

          <tp:rationale>
            <p>If properties that could change were included, the following
              race condition would be likely to exist in some cases:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>NewChannels or Get("Channels") includes a property P with
                value V1</li>
              <li>Client creates a proxy object for the channel</li>
              <li>The value of P changes to V2</li>
              <li>Client connects to PChanged signal</li>
              <li>Client should call Get("P") or GetAll here, to avoid the
                race, but client's author has forgotten to do so</li>
              <li>Proxy object thinks P == V1, but actually P == V2</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We've taken the opportunity to make the API encourage the
              client author to get it right. Where possible, we intend that
              properties whose value will be used in channel dispatching
              or other "early" processing will be defined so that they are
              immutable (can never change).</p>

          <p>A dictionary containing desirable properties. Some properties
            are defined such that only an exact match makes sense, and
            connection managers MUST NOT satisfy a request with a channel
            where that property does not match; some properties are defined
            such that the connection manager MAY treat the request as merely
            a hint, and make a best-effort attempt to satisfy it. This is
            documented separately for each property.</p>

          <p>If this dictionary contains a property whose semantics
            are not known to the connection manager, this method MUST fail
